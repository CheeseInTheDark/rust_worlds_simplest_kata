# The World's Simplest Kata: Rust Edition

Welcome to the world's simplest kata! The task is simple. The build is failing.
The code has one function, and a simple main method.
Make the red Actions in GitHub green. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

For the Rust edition, there are three types of errors: [unit test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html),
[formatting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt), and [linting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).

## How To

* Fork the repo.
* Make it green.
* ...
* Profit!
